        "question": "Write down the features of spanning tree?",
        "answer": "A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices and is a tree. Features of a spanning tree include being acyclic, connected, and covering all the vertices of the original graph."

        "Sno": 2,
        "question": "Why elements in binary search are sorted in nature?",
        "answer": "Binary search relies on comparing the middle element of a sorted array with the target value. Sorting is necessary to maintain order, allowing efficient divide-and-conquer searching by eliminating half of the remaining elements in each step."

      {
        "Sno": 3,
        "question": "Write down the different types of storage representation of the graph",
        "answer": "Graphs can be represented using various data structures, including adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and adjacency set. Each representation has its advantages and is suitable for different types of operations on the graph."

        "Sno": 4,
        "question": "What do you mean by asymptotic notation? Explain with its types.",
        "answer": "Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity. Types include Big O (upper bound), Omega (lower bound), and Theta (tight bound), providing information about the worst-case, best-case, and average-case time complexities."

        "Sno": 5,
        "question": "Discuss Kruskal's algorithm with the help of suitable examples",
        "answer": "Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, weighted graph. It involves sorting the edges by weight and adding them to the spanning tree if they do not form a cycle. Example: Consider a graph with weighted edges, and Kruskal's algorithm would iteratively select edges to create the minimum spanning tree."

        "Sno": 6,
        "question": "What is sorting?",
        "answer": "Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, often in ascending or descending order. It is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in various algorithms and applications."
      },
      {
        "Sno": 7,
        "question": "Explain linear search",
        "answer": "Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the entire list has been searched. It has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case."

      {
        "Sno": 8,
        "question": "What do you mean by a graph? What is the difference between a graph and a spanning tree?",
        "answer": "A graph is a collection of nodes and edges that connect pairs of nodes. A spanning tree is a subset of edges from a graph, forming a tree that includes all vertices. The key difference is that a graph can have cycles and disconnected components, while a spanning tree is acyclic and connected."

      {
        "Sno": 9,
        "question": "What do you mean by time and space complexity of an algorithm?",
        "answer": "Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses. Both are crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms."

      {
        "Sno": 10,
        "question": "Explain the concept of adjacency matrix in graph theory.",
        "answer": "An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The element at row i and column j represents whether there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j. It is a straightforward way to represent the connections between vertices in a graph."

      {
        "Sno": 11,
        "question": "Differentiate between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).",
        "answer": "Breadth-first search explores all the vertices at the current level before moving on to the next level. Depth-first search explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking. BFS uses a queue data structure, while DFS uses a stack or recursion."

      {
        "Sno": 12,
        "question": "Explain the importance of quicksort in comparison-based sorting algorithms.",
        "answer": "Quicksort is efficient in practice and widely used due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n). It has low constant factors, making it faster for small to medium-sized datasets. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) in rare cases."

      {
        "Sno": 13,
        "question": "Describe the concept of memoization in dynamic programming.",
        "answer": "Memoization is a technique where the results of expensive function calls are stored and reused, avoiding redundant computations. In dynamic programming, it involves caching the solutions to subproblems, reducing the time complexity of the algorithm."

      {
        "Sno": 14,
        "question": "What is the significance of the Master Theorem in algorithm analysis?",
        "answer": "The Master Theorem is used to analyze the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms. It provides a formula for the time complexity in terms of recurrence relations, simplifying the analysis of algorithms with a specific structure."
