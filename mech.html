                    <li><b>Kinematics:</b>&nbsp; It deals with the bodies in the motion without any reference to the force which are responsible for the motion.</li>

        <li>It is the science which deals with the physical state of rest or motion of the bodies under the action of force.</li><li>Depending upon the nature of the body involved, it can be further divided into mechanics of rigid bodies, mechanics of fluids.</li>
        <li><b>Rigid Bodies : </b>Rigid bodies are those which do not deform under the action of applied force.
        <br><ul style="margin-left: 1rem;"><li>
            The mechanics of rigid bodies is studies in two parts: Statics and Dynamics.
        </li>
    <li>
        Statics deals with bodies at rest and Dynamics deals with bodies in motion.
    </li></ul></li>
    <li>
        <b>Particles: </b>It is defines as an object use mass is concentrated at a point . This assumption made with the size of a body is negligible and irrelevent to the study of motion of the body.
    </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-black-50">Basic Definations</h1><br>
        The Study of mechanics involves the concept of Space, Time, Mass, Force. <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Concept of Space: </b> It is essential to fixed the position of a point. To fully define the position of a point in space, we shall need to define some form of reference and coordinate system.</li>
            <li><b>Concept of Time: </b> It is essential to relate the sequence of the event. <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;For Example: </b>Starting and Stoping of the motion of a body.</li>
            <li><b>Concept of Mass: </b> It is essential as an agency which change or tends to change the state of rest or the state of uniform motion of a body.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <h1 class="text-black-50">Fundamental Principles</h1><br>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Newton's 1<sup>st</sup> Law of Motion: </b>Every body continues in a state of rest or of
            uniform motion in a straight line unless it is employed to change that state by a
            force imposed on the body.

        </li>
        <li><b>Newton's 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Motion: </b>
            The acceleration of a given particles is
            proportion to the impressed force and taken place in the direction of the
            straight line in which the force is impressed. <br><b>OR</b><br>The rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force
            acting on it.</li><br>
            <img src="/img/1.png" alt="Image Not found"><br>
            <li><b>Newton's 3<sup>rd</sup> Law of Motion: </b>To every action thereis equal and opposite reaction which means that the forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
                </li>
                <li><b>Newton's 4<sup>th</sup> Law of Motion: </b>- A force is defined as the action of one body on another force is the agent which changes or tends to changes the state of rest or uniform motion of a body. A force is a vector because its effects depends on the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action on the body.
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                            The S.I. unit of force is “Newton” which is denoted by (N). 1N force be define as the force which produces an acceleration of <b> 1m/ sec <sup>2</sup> </b>a body of <b>mass 1KG.</b></li>
